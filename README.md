# SuperHeroHQ

To see the final result just access the page http://3.22.149.92

REST API/Backoffice:
To create both i used visual studio, since it is a IDE that I'm used to work with;
I used xampp and created a mySQL database to be accessed by the API.
I did all locally and just uploaded on AWS server.
The only difference between locally code and the one in the server is the url (http://localhost in my computer and http://3.22.149.92 for the server).
The REST API code is in the folder php_rest_superherohq.
The backoffice code is in the folder super_heroes_hq.
If it is of our interest you can see the database structure in the file Layout.PNG.
For backoffice i decide to go with my on design instead of look for some css premade layout online.
